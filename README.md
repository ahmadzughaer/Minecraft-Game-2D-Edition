This is minecraft game clone using only HTML, CSS &amp; JS 

gameBoardGrid used to create game grid layout 
landDraw, cloudDraw, treeDraw, rockDraw and grassDraw used  to draw all these elments inside the gameBoardGrid 
gameMapDrawer used to put all the elments inside the whole world 
resetGame used to reset the map to its default status 
collectMaterial used to pick the correct material form the map 
updateInventory used to add to the right set of material once harvested 
rebuildMaterials used to put the inventory to the map

what was challenging is to save all the inventory separately and differentiate the tools functionality after hours of thinking and search I come over the solution.
